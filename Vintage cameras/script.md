# Vintage Cameras

Good morning,

For your history topic, I'm going to show you two old cameras that I own and talk a little about their history. One of the cameras belonged to my father and the other one was given to me.

First I want to explain a little bit about how pictures used to be taken.

* How many of you have taken a picture with maybe your parent's phone?
* And how did you look at the picture that was taken?
* You could see it straight away, right?
* (And can one of you tell me where the picture is?)
* How many pictures can you take with your parent's phone?
* Do your parents have a printer at home that can put the picture on paper?
* How long does it take to put the picture on paper?

Well, with the cameras I'm about to show you, you couldn't see the picture straight away. The picture was put on film, which is kind of like a plastic sheet.

Once you took the picture, you would take the film to a camera shop, or the chemist. At the shop, the film would be *Developed*, which means to turn it into a picture that you can see. The shop would then use the *Developed* film to make prints on paper. It would normally take a couple of days before you could see the pictures.

So with these cameras, you can't see the picture straight away. Also, you would only get 1 print of the picture and if you wanted another print you would have to go back to the shop and ask for a print. This would normally take another day.

## Folding bellows camera - Kodak No 1A Pocket Junior
```
Camera closed
```
This camera was made between 1926 and 1932, so it is now 86 to 92 years old!

It is called a Pocket camera and was made by a company called Kodak.

Do you think you can fit this in your pocket?

In those days, this was a small camera!

This type of camera is a Bellows camera. Let me show you.
```
Open cameras
```

This part here, is called the *bellows*.

The film for this camera goes in the back. You have to almost take the camera apart to load the film.

```
Open back of camera
Show back of lens
```
This rectangle shows how big the film was.
```
Show film housing
Remove spindle
```
This is where the film goes.

The film is wound around this spindle like a toilet paper roll.

This camera could hold only 12 pictures

```
close camera
```
When you want to take a picture, you turn this dial so you get a new part of the film.

Then, like cameras today, you point the camera and push a button.

Now you have to take 12 pictures before you can take the film to the shop to be developed and printed!

## Compact
This second camera was made between 1954 and 1957.

So it is between 61 and 64 years old.

This camera belonged to my father, Miraya's grand father.

My father would let me use it too.

This camera worked in much the same way as the Bellows camera, but the film was smaller and easier to load.

```
Show film canister
```
This is a roll of film.

You could take 24 picture with this roll. But you still had to take it to a shop to get it developed and printed.

I don't use this camera anymore, because it is expensive to buy the film and have it developed.
