# Vintage Cameras

## Intro

2 old Cameras
1. Very old , given
2. Not as old , belonged to my father , **Miraya's Grandfather**

## Photography in the past
**Questions**

* How many of you have taken a picture with maybe your parent's phone?
* And how did you look at the picture that was taken?
* You could see it straight away, right?
* (And can one of you tell me where the picture is?)
* How many pictures can you take with your parent's phone?
* Do your parents have a printer at home that can put the picture on paper?
* How long does it take to put the picture on paper?

Old cameras -
* No picture straight away
* Picture on film in camera
  * Like a sheet of plastic
* takes a few days to see pictures
  * Finish film
  * Take to shop for develop & print
* more prints? Back to shop

Now will show some cameras.

You can have a closer look when I finished.

## 1. Kodak Pocket
```

```

Made between 1926 - 1932

86 to 92 years Old

Kodak Pocket

Small for its days

```

```

Point to & few words on
* lens

* winder / crank

Demonstrate taking a picture

Let me show you how to load the film

```
Open back of camera
```

See through bellows

Hole at back is size of film

Called the *Frame*

```

```
This is where the film goes.

This camera could take 12 pictures

```
Remove spindle
```

The film is like a plastic sheet

winds around spindle

Winding the crank will turn the spindle and pull the film ready for a new picture.

Take 12 and then take to shop for developing & printing.

Pictures were B & W only!

Here is example of picture that could have been taken with this camera

## 2. Kodak Retina
This second camera is not as old.

He bought it in Holland and took pictures of me & my sisters growing up.

When I got older, he let me use it.

The camera works in same way

* shutter button
* winder / crank

Film goes in Back

```

See that frame is smaller
