## Family
My father was born in Indonesia. His name has the title **Raden**, which is Indonesian for *Sir*.

He inherited the title because our **family is actually related to** a Sultan - a ruler - called **Raden Patah**.

He lived in Indonesia **500 years ago** (was born in 1455 and died in 1518).

Raden Patah was the first Sultan - the ruler - of a place called **Demak**. Demak still exists today as a town on the island of Java.

This image of Raden Patah shows him carry a dagger or **Keris** in his sash.

I want to tell you more about the Keris.

## Indonesian Keris
The word “keris” means to "stab" or to "pierce".

Kerises were first made in the 7th century, **more than 1,500 years ago**.

We know this because historians find stories and references to Krises in other old artefacts.

This picture of a 1,100 year old temple in Indonesia shows a Keris.

This statue is of Gaja Mada holding his Keris. He was a Prime Minister in Indonesia in 1336 - 682 years ago.

The oldest Kris that still exists today is 676 years old.

600 years ago, most Javanese men and women carried a Keris as part of their normal clothes.

Today, people in Indonesia still wear a Kris but only for special occasions such as weddings or religious ceremonies.

A man's Keris is usually passed to the first born son. In this way a Keris can be passed through generations and becomes a **family heirloom**.

I'm going to show a short video of people making Kerises. The way of making a Keris has not changed for thousands of years.

What do you think I have brought with me?

We have to treat a Keris very carefully.

Because Indonesians believe that a spirit lives inside the blade.

The Spirit protects the owner and can provide wealth.

But the Spirit needs to be looked after.

We look after the spirit by oiling the blade and giving offerings to the spirit living in the blade.

When the Keris is made, the Empu uses magical powers to call the Spirit to come and live in the Keris.

A powerful and experienced Empu can call powerful spirits.

## Backup
Keris and kris blades are now known to be indigenous to regions of Indonesia, Southern Thailand, Brunei, the Southern Philippines, and Malaysia.
